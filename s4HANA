We have 1 demo / workflow for S4 for Tech Ed and it is Extending S/4HANA with External Data. You will combine data from a Hadoop system to data in an S4 system via CDS. 

The workflow to connect to add data to S/4HANA is normally:

1)	Add a Smart Data Access connection in HANA
2)	Add a Virtual Table, from the Remote Data Source, in HANA
3)	Create a Calculation View off of the HANA Virtual Table
4)	Add an External View to the ABAP Data Dictionary (ABAP DDIC)
5)	Create a CDS view off of the External View
6)	Extend an existing CDS consumption view.

In this particular demo there have been some steps above that are already done. Weâ€™ve already done steps 1 to 3. We have also created a couple of CDS views, one of which is extended by you in step 6.

This script was written for use on S/4HANA 1610 FPS00 or FPS01 On-Premise Edition. 


Steps for you:
1) You need to obtain an S4 User ID from the HANA Academy to follow this workflow.
2) In the S/4HANA folder in Chrome, open the "Extending S4..." link in a new window to get the current script so that you can download it to your machine.
3) Feel free to ask the HANA Academy any questions should they arise.
